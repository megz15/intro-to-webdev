					<h3>What is Web Dev?</h3>
					<p>
						Web Development is the process of developing a website or a web application.
					</p><p>
						It typically involves applying a combination of different technologies called stacks, which include programming languages, databases, frameworks, among other stuff to build and deploy interactive and dynamic websites.
					</p>

						<h3>Why Web Dev?</h3>
						<p>
							Web Development is an exciting and rewarding field to get into, and offers a wide range of opportunities for personal and professional growth.
						</p><p>
							Below are some reasons to get into web development:
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<dl>
								<li><dt>High demand</dt></li>
								<dd>With the increasing importance of the internet in our daily lives, the demand for web developers has skyrocketed in recent years.</dd>
								<br>
								<li><dt>One Codebase to Rule Them All</dt></li>
								<dd>Developers don't need to maintain multiple codebases for huge projects.</dd>

					<h3>What is a front end and how is it different from a back one?</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Frontend</h3>
						<p>
							Frontend development involves creating user interfaces of a website or web application while keeping user experience in mind (UI/UX).
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							This includes designing and developing whatever the client interacts with, including the layout, visual components, and dynamic, interactive features, usually using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Backend</h3>
						<p>
							Backend development focuses on the server-side of web development. It involves user authentication and authorization, managing data, APIs among many other things.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Backends are written in programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Dart, Rust, PHP etc.
						</p>
						<p>
							NodeJS is a commonly used js runtime environment that is used as a backend, Flask and Django are common Python frameworks for web dev.
						</p>
					</section>

					<h3>How do I start making frontend stuff?</h3>
					<p>To start with frontend, you will need to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>HTML</h3>
						<p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the markup language used to create the structure of a webpage.</p>
						<p>HTML consists of a series of elements, or content enclosed in tags.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Here's a simple example:</h4>
						<pre><code>
		&lt;html&gt;

			&lt;title&gt;Example&lt;/title&gt;
		&lt;/head&gt;
		&lt;body&gt;
			&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the workshop!&lt;/h1&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;This is a simple example.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

						<h3>CSS</h3>
						<p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to make HTML more sexy.</p>
						<p>It involves selectors, properties, and values, as well as how to apply styles to different HTML elements.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Here's a simple example:</h4>
						<pre><code>
		/* Styles for the body of the page */
		body {
		font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
		background-color: coral;
		}

		/* Styles for the heading */
		h1 {
		color: #252525;
		text-align: center;
		}

		/* Styles for the paragraph */
		p {
		font-size: 18px;
		line-height: 1.5;
		margin-bottom: 20px;
		}

		/* Styles for the list */
		ul {
		list-style-type: disc;
		margin-left: 20px;
		}

		/* Styles for the list items */
		li {
		font-size: 16px;
		line-height: 1.2;
		}
						</code></pre>
					</section>

						<h3>CSS Frameworks</h3>
						<p>These are pre-written sets of CSS and sometimes JavaScript code that provide a set of standardized styles, layouts, and UI components that can be easily customized and reused throughout a project.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Well known CSS frameworks:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Bulma</li>
							<li>Bootstrap</li>
							<li>Tailwind</li>
							<li>Foundation</li>

							Directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development, Bootstrap focuses on simplifying the development of web pages with its several inbuilt HTML, CSS and JavaScript components.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Bulma</h3>
						<p>
							Bulma is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, with a simple and intuitive class names and a variety of easily customizable pre-built CSS components.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Tailwind</h3>
						<p>
							Tailwind CSS is designed to be highly customizable, in that allows developers to quickly and easily apply pre-built CSS classes to their HTML elements.
						</p>
						<p>
							It includes a wide range of pre-built utility classes for typography, spacing, layout, colors, borders, and more.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>JavaScript</h3>
						<p>JS is a programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web pages.</p>
						<p>It includes covering a range of programming fundamentals like data types, variables, functions, conditional statements, and loops.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Here's a simple example:</h4>
						<pre><code>
		function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
			var sum = num1 + num2;
			return sum;
		}

		function changeText() {
			var heading = document.getElementById("heading");
			heading.innerHTML = `5 + 15 = ${addNumbers(5, 15)}`;
		}

	changeText();
						</code></pre>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>JavaScript Frameworks</h3>
						<p>These are pre-written JS code that provide a set of libraries and tools for building web applications.</p>
						<p>They allow developers to focus on the high-level aspects of the application, without having to worry about the underlying details and re-inventing the wheel by rewriting trivial code.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Well known JS frameworks:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Svelte</li>
							<li>Vue.js</li>
							<li>React</li>
							<li>AngularJS</li>
							<li>Ember.js</li>
							<li>Alpine.js</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<h3>Svelte</h3>
						<p>
							Svelte is a modern web framework that focuses on building highly efficient and fast web applications by moving much of the work that typically happens at runtime to build time.
						</p>
						<p>
							Svelte compiles application code into highly efficient vanilla JavaScript, resulting in smaller bundle sizes, faster load times, and better overall performance.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Vue.js</h3>
						<p>
							Vue.JS is a progressive framework that is designed to be incrementally adoptable. It also has a small learning curve, making it an ideal choice for beginners.
						</p>
						<p>
							Vue.js uses a reactive data binding system. This makes it easy to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces without having to write a lot of boilerplate code.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>React</h3>
						<p>
							Technically not a framework, React is a popular open-source library developed by Facebook.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of its main features is its component-based architecture, which allows the interface to be broken down into smaller, reusable pieces of code.
						</p>
						<p>
							React uses a virtual DOM to update the UI to minimize the number of updates that need to be made to the actual DOM.
						</p>

						<h3>How do I create a backend?</h3>
						<p>Now that you know how to go about making a decent frontend, lets talk about the backend</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Do I even need a backend?</h3>
						<p>
							A simple static website or even a dynamic one that doesn't need to rely on complex functionality like data storage and user authentication would not need a backend.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, a backend is necessary when the web application requires dynamic functionality like authentication, user-generated content, or real-time updates.
						</p>

						<h3>How do I Start Learning Web Dev?</h3>
						<p>
							Once you have made the decision to get into the world of web development, there are a few approaches you can take to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
